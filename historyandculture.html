  St. Louis was founded in 1764 as a
  French fur-trading village by Pierre
  Laclede. He named the city “St. Louis”
  for King Louis IX, the crusader king
  who was the patron saint of Laclede’s
  then ruler King Louis XV.

    In 1904, St. Louis hosted the World's Fair, a large international exhibition designed to showcase achievements of nations. It was at this event that the ice cream cone was invented!
    From April 30 to December 1, 1904. Local, state, and federal funds totaling $15 million were used to finance the event. More than 60 countries
    and 43 of the then-45 American states maintained exhibition spaces at the fair, which was attended by nearly 19.7 million people.

    The Hill. My pride and joy. The area that symbolizes so much to so many in St. Louis. Located on high ground south of Forest Park, The Hill began with immigrants from Northern Italy,
    Germany, Ireland, and African-Americans who wanted to live near the railroad which connected the neighborhood to downtown. The vast numbers
    of Italians migrating to the area resulted in an Italian American majority population during the early part of the 20th century. Now, what's deemed the "Last Little Italy", The Hill continues the rich
    italian culture of St. Louis with its numerous family-owned restaurants, homes, and murals. A sea of green, white and red populated every fire hydrant and light pole.
